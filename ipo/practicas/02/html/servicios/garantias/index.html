                <h2> WARRANTY </h2>
                    <p> Each new Alter Cycles comes with a manufacturer’s warranty for the original retail purchaser. PROOF OF ASSEMBLY BY AN E-BIKE SPECIALIST OR BICYCLE DEALER IS REQUIRED FOR VALID WARRANTY. This warranty provides each original retail purchaser of a Alter Cycles motorbike with a warranty against manufacturer's defects. The warranty claim is directed at the respective dealer or location of purchase and is covered by the manufacturer. Servicing may be done at any of Alter Cycles, Inc. authorized dealers. </p>
                    <p> Warranty claims only exist for initial faults that were already present at the time of handover. Alter Cycles, Inc. grants a 90-day guarantee for manufacturing defects resulting in the failure of the frame, fork, and electronics. This includes the battery, motor, controller, display, and sensors. The Alter Cycles is intended for use on paved road only. </p>
                    <p> Damage caused by stunt riding, racing, or other abusive treatment is not covered by this warranty. This is a consumer warranty and does not apply to products used commercially or in rental operations. </p>
                    <p> This warranty, which goes beyond the requirements of statutory legislation for defect liability, will only apply if the following points are met: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> If bike was purchased from Alter Cycles, Inc. or one of it's authorized dealers or distributors </li>
                        <li> If you are the original and first owner of the bike (warranty is not transferable in the case of a re-sale) </li>
                        <li> If bike has followed all intended use purposes </li>
                        <li> If the electronics have not been repaired or modified. </li>
                        <li> If the bike was assembled by a certified E-Bike specialist or Bicycle Dealer </li>
                        <li> If product registration was submitted at: https://altercycles.com/pages/register </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> All disassembly and shipping costs incurred will be the sole responsibility of the owner. This warranty is only valid for the first buyer. Any other remedy, such as compensation or loss of use, is excluded. The warranty period cannot be extended by granting an additional warranty. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> The conditions of the present warranty will apply only if the bike is bought on the territory of the mainland United States of America (plus Hawaii and Alaska), and remains there. No vendor or distributor may change the terms of this warranty unless the vendor or distributor replaces the Alter Cycles, Inc. warranty terms with its own warranty terms on the company’s letterhead.

                <h2> INFORMATION ON WEAR AND TEAR </h2>

                <p> Some components of your bike are subject to wear owing to their function. The extent of wear depends on the care, maintenance and nature of the use of your Alter Cycles (mileage, riding in rain, dirt, salt, etc.). Bikes that are often left outside can also be subject to increased wear due to weathering. The parts must be replaced once they reach their wear limit. This includes but is not limited to: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> the drive chain or toothed belt </li>
                    <li> the brake cables </li>
                    <li> the rubber hand grips </li>
                    <li> the sprockets, pinions or toothed belt discs </li>
                    <li> the gear cables </li>
                    <li> the tires </li>
                    <li> the saddle cover </li>
                    <li> the brake pads </li>
                    <li> the rims or brake discs </li>
                </ul>

                <p> The brake pads and disks are subject to wear owing to their function. Check the condition of the pads regularly and, if necessary, have them replaced by a specialist dealer. Brake discs also wear out. Regularly have the thickness of the brake discs checked as part of inspection and replace the components, if necessary. Replacing these parts due to wear, is not subject to the statutory warranty. Environmental factors cause wear on these moving parts. These areas must be regularly cleaned and maintained. </p>

                <p> Depending on the operating conditions, it cannot be ruled out that parts will have to be replaced due to wear (e.g. if bearing play starts to occur). You must contact your dealer before arranging repairs in order to ensure the quickest and most cost-effective way to deal with your issue. Shipping and disassembly instructions from either the dealer or Alter Cycles, Inc. must be followed. Otherwise warranty service will not be provided. Failure to comply with the assembly specifications and inspection intervals can void the warranty and liability for defects. </p>
